2/3 of IT projects and budgets CJIS is involved with
they are very smart, don't like baby being ugly

Mantech does the O&M work
works closely with contractors - once you prove yourself, you become part of their team

in O&M state - no big projects
starting to rebuild NCIC (sits on IBM boxes)
starting to transition to the cloud based on OMB directives
CJIS has been successul in last couple months
have moved some applications successfully

when we looked at Zscaler cloud security capability, it was good timing - security issues was limiting the cloud adoption

brian is the section chief over it

george white is security person
chris weatherly - CJIS ISSO
stephanie reid - interested in remote user capabilities

lot of specific technical capabilities

lots of high volume transactions - like to talk to banking industries and healthcare as comparable high volume
has to be available, has to be secured

how can it reduce their IT O&M - get a lot of money by doing background checks
they get $350m a year from fingerprint checks (not all non-criminal)
appropriated money is used for O&M

attendees are eclectivc - section, unit, program chiefs, and architects
some work well together, others dont
